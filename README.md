# Cell-Culture
Allows for the generation of cell-culture data.

Whenever possible, data is generated from core mechanics so that an arbitrary
change to experimental design will create data that reflects this.  E.G. a 
change to feeding strategy or agitation rate will accurately be reflected in
things like VCD.

This tool could, in theory, be used to:
  Look at how important accuracy and precision in assays are
  Generate DoE data and assess accuracy of results
  Train and test ML algorithms*
  Teach students what real data would look like and how to derive parameters 
    from it.  
  
*obviously, don't use this as training data to predict on real world data.

Currently implemented:
  Various assays, all with their own forms of error (systematic, drift, random)
    and calibration schemes
  Randomly generated cell lines with 30+ varying parameters
  Modular control strategies and actuation devices
  Customizable bioreactor setup**
  Cell model that loosely reflects RL data
    Includes basic PQ data
    
A note on the cell model: The cell model is intended to approximate real-world
data on things like cell phases, osmo tolerance, nutrient consumption, etc.
I am not a cell biologist, and many of the underlying mechanics are not accurate.
However, they are intended to be sufficiently randomized yet still correlated
with environmental conditions that a ML model could attempt to train on and learn 
from the data generated, the idea being that if it can pick up correlations that
have not been hard coded then it can pick up other correlations in real CC data.
